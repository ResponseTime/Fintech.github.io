        <h1>BLOCKCHAIN</h1>
        Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack,
        or cheat the system.

        A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the
        entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions,
        and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every
        participant’s ledger. The decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger
        Technology (DLT).

        deposits, transfers, and online bill payments. Virtually every banking institution has some form of online

        Crowdfunding is the use of small amounts of capital from a large number of individuals to finance a new business
        venture. Crowdfunding makes use of the easy accessibility of vast networks of people through social media and
        crowdfunding websites to bring investors and entrepreneurs together, with the potential to increase
        entrepreneurship by expanding the pool of investors beyond the traditional circle of owners, relatives, and
        venture capitalists.
